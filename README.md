This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Router v6 related to the `useLocation` hook and nested routes.  The bug manifests as a console warning and potential unexpected behavior during navigation, especially when dealing with nested routes. The solution involves correctly importing and using the `useLocation` hook in components where it's needed to properly access and utilize the current location within nested routes.
